Spidex3d/SpxGui is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its mine.
Hi I'm the Dyslexic Programmer.
I'm not really a programmer, I'm a retired horticulturist.
iv only played with C++ and found it very interesting
so now I have lots of time to try and learn this stuff at 68 left it a bit late me think.

I'm using Visual studio 2022, glad, GLwin, glm, stb
This projects aim is to make my own gui which works with my GLwin project but should work with GLFW.
Only works on Windows.
